# Transposable-Elements-Expression-Analysis-Pipeline
In this project, we have utilized the RNA-Seq data to detect the Transposable Elements (TEs) expression using TEtranscript package (The Gale Hammell Lab). Here, in this project, we have analyzed the Morc3 alleles (Morc3b and Morc3ab) mutants post fertilization time points (i:e 6 hpf and 24hpf) bulk RNA-Seq data. 
### Required Tools 
1) &nbsp; Pre-processing <br />
2) &nbsp; Genome alignment with STAR  <br />
3) &nbsp; Post-Alignment formatting and filtering with SAMtools <br />
4) &nbsp; TE expression identification with TEtranscript (pre-installed at Sapelo2 GACRC)
5) &nbsp; DESeq2 R-Package to detect the differentially expressed TEs (Integrated installed in TEtranscript )


### 1) Pre-processing:
