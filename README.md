# Transposable-Elements-Expression-Analysis-Pipeline
## Overview
In this project, we have utilized the RNA-Seq data to detect the Transposable Elements (TEs) expression using TEtranscript package (The Gale Hammell Lab). Here, in this project, we have analyzed the Morc3 alleles (Morc3b and Morc3ab) mutants post fertilization time points (i:e 6 hpf and 24hpf) bulk RNA-Seq data. 
### Required Tools 
1) &nbsp; TrimGlore (for pre-processing) <br />
2) &nbsp; STAR (for alignment) <br />
3) &nbsp; SAMtools (post-processing and formatting) <br />
4) &nbsp; TEtranscript (pre-installed at Sapelo2 GACRC)
5) &nbsp; DESeq2 R-Package to detect the differentially expressed TEs
